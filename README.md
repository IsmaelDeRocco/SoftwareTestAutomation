How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

There are many ways to make sure your code is functional and secure but the ones I use are by created tests. With the tests it can be seen if the program is working the way it should. A test should be done often to make sure nothing breaks as you are coding. It’s better to catch the problems earlier on then all at the end.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

The easiest way is to first talk with the client and get a general aspect of what exactly they want. Pseudo code could then be done so it’s easy to set up the program and it makes it easy for the client to be able to read program even without knowing how to code.

How do I approach designing software?

How I start a program is first by seeing if there is an object that I need to create that will come up multiple times. It’s easier and more practical to create functions and objects that will be used multiple times as their own classes to be called when needed. My rule of thumb when writing code is that the main should only really call functions that are all done in their own separate classes so if something breaks it can be located easier and it is also much more user friendly to read.
